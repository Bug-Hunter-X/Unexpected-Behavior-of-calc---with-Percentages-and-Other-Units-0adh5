The solution is to avoid mixing percentage and fixed units within the `calc()` function.  Instead, use a consistent unit system.  If you need to calculate a width relative to its container and subtract a fixed amount, consider using only pixels or ems:

```css
/* Solution 1: Using only percentages */
.element {
  width: 45%; /* Approximate 50% - 10px */
}

/* Solution 2: Using only pixels */
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px); /*May need adjustment based on container width*/ 
}

/*Solution 3: Using ems - better for responsiveness*/
.element {
  width: calc(50vw - 1em);
}
```

By using a consistent unit system, the calculation will be more accurate and reliable across different browsers.
