The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages and other units. For example, the following code may not produce the desired result:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

In some cases, the browser may not correctly calculate the width of the element, and it may appear smaller or larger than expected.
